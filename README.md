# Project-Log-file-Analyzer-using-Intrusion-detection-
This project helps to detect suspicious activities from server log files using Python. It finds IP addresses with too many access attempts and marks them as possible threats. The system also checks if those IPs appear in public blacklists. Results are shown through easy-to-understand reports and charts.
